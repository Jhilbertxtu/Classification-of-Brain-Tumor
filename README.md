# Classification-of-Brain-Tumor
Classifying type of Brain Tumor that whether it is Pituitary or Maningioma
The dataset has been taken from https://figshare.com/articles/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427
The classifcation has been done using Logistic Regression, Shallow Neural network, Deep Neural network, and Support Vector Machine(SVM). It found that Deep Neural Network classifies brain dataset the best, that is it gives best accuracy with test dataset.
